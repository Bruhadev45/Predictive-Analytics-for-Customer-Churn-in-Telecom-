# Predictive Analytics for Customer Churn in Telecom

This project focuses on applying predictive analytics techniques to forecast customer churn in the telecom industry. By utilizing machine learning models and exploratory data analysis, the system identifies key factors that lead to customer churn and predicts which customers are at risk of leaving the service.

## Description

Customer churn is a critical issue in the telecom industry, impacting revenue and growth. This project leverages historical customer data to build predictive models that help telecom companies identify customers likely to churn. The insights gained from this project can assist in formulating customer retention strategies and improving customer service.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing data, encoding categorical variables, and scaling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations to understand patterns and correlations within the data.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implementation of various machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine to predict churn.
- **Model Evaluation**: Includes metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC to evaluate the performance of each model.
- **Feature Importance**: Analysis of the most influential factors contributing to customer churn.
